# All the Ghibli Things!

Welcome to All the Ghibli Things! A library with games dedicated to Ghibli films. It encompasses various elements such as characters, locations, houses, and foods featured in the films.

## About

### Background

I started this full-stack project while studying at my bootcamp for the purpose of consolidating my learning in a fun way. While I have made some progress, there are many goals I am still working on.

Some of the things I want to consolidate:

* front-end routing
* query calls
* mutations
* creating end-points
* [deploying](https://ghibli-things.devacademy.nz)

Some ✨ new ✨ things I want to try out:

* creating popups
* game-logic (created a short quiz game as well as puzzles)
* dynamic image manipulation

### Methods used

* API endpoints
* React components
* database modules
* API client modules

### Games

There are currently two games on this app:
* a quiz where you identify the film each character, location, or food item is from.
* a jigsaw puzzle where you can drag and drop pieces.
