# All the Ghibli Things!

## About

### Background

I started this full-stack project while studying at my bootcamp for the purpose of consolidating my learning in a fun way. While I have made some progress, there are many goals I am still working on.

Some of the things I want to consolidate:

* front-end routing
* query calls
* mutations
* creating end-points
* [deploying](https://ghibli-things.devacademy.nz)

Some ✨ new ✨ things I want to try out:

* creating popups
* game-logic (created a short quiz game as well as puzzles)
* dynamic image manipulation

### Methods used

* multiple API endpoints
* multiple React components
* database modules
* API client modules

## Installation - **From the command line**

```
git clone https://github.com/haruka-ogino/ghibli-things.git
cd ghibli-things
npm install # to install dependencies
npm run dev # to start the dev server
```

You can find the server running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the client running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
